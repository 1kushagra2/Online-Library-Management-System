--> Title : Design and Implementation of an Online Library Management System

Introduction :-

This mini project aims to design and develop an Online Library Management System (OLMS) that not only provides basic functionalities of a library but also ensures data security and concurrency control. The system employs socket programming to enable multiple clients to access the library database concurrently. Additionally, system calls are utilized extensively for various operations such as process management, file handling, file locking, multithreading, and inter-process communication, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization

--> Implementation detail :-

1) The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and secure Online Library Management System that caters to the needs of both library administrators and users. Specific objectives include:

2) Implementation of user authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to member accounts.

3) Incorporation of password-protected administrative access to prevent unauthorized usage.

4) Implementing the basic functionality of Online Library System such as adding, deleting users and books modifying the quantity of book and ,viewing the list of book issued by the user and also books present in the library

5) Implementation of file-locking mechanisms using system calls to ensure data consistency and concurrency control.

Utilization of socket programming to facilitate concurrent access to the library database by multiple clients.
